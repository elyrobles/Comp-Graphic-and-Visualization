## How do I approach designing software?

After taking this course, I have learned a lot about designing software and the complexity that comes with it. As someone who is pursuing a career in product design, understanding design requirements is crucial for creating products that are engaging and user-friendly. Because this 3D Scene project had many moving parts, I decided to follow a very simple and similar design process I normally follow when creating new designs, which is to understand the requirements and required functionality, come up with a plan on how to achieve my desired results, work in iterations until my desired result is achieved, and finally, test to ensure the product is working and functioning properly.

For example, in week 2, after brainstorming which objects I wanted to recreate for my 3D Scene, I set up my scene with multiple objects and took a photo of them which I used for reference throughout the entirety of the project. In week 3, I worked on creating my complex object of the scene, which was the makeup item which consisted of a sphere and cylinder. In week 4 I added a plane and camera movement to my scene. In week 5, I added texture. In week 6, I added light, and in week 7, I finished the rest of my objects and added them to the same 3D scene, then rendered my project to ensure all objects were placed and sized correctly on the plane. This iterative process goes to show how effective it is to separate a complex project into more manageable parts. I plan to continue using this process in future product design work. 

## How do I approach developing programs?

I gained a lot of new development strategies while working on my 3D scene using OpenGL. For example, I learned how to create three-dimensional objects using geometrical data and utilizing various reusable functions to render my shapes, such as the functions in my shader class which allowed me to utilize the vertex buffer object, element buffer object, vertex array object, and drawing operations effectively. I also learned how to incorporate transformations into my project to be able to rotate, scale, and manipulate the objects to appear a certain way within my scene. Lastly, I discovered how to create custom vertex and fragment shaders to implement the effects shown in my rendered scene, such as the soft lighting and the textures on my objects. 

Using an iterative process, as I mentioned above, has always been an extremely effective approach for me when it comes to pretty much any development and design projects. Being able to break things down into smaller tasks, such as focusing on textures, lighting, and camera movements on different weeks, allowed me to concentrate on one aspect at a time, without getting too overwhelmed by the complexity of the project. 

## How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

Computational graphics and visualizations gave me new knowledge and skills that can be applied to my future professional pathway of product design. In the field of product design, prototypes play a significant role in the design process, whether that be wireframe mockups for a new mobile app or website, or 3D designs that can be used for certain electronics such as wearable technology or medical devices. 

With my newfound knowledge in OpenGL, I now have the ability to apply the skills I have learned in this course to any kind of project that requires 3D modeling, of course with continued learning to enhance my skills in OpenGL. This 3D modeling will give clients, stakeholders, other designers, and engineers the ability to visualize the outcome of a product before production.
